As the title says, you as a reader should get ready for an awesome adventure. My name is Landon Gravat, and I am back. All of my previous blogs have failed, but as I am managing my time better, this should fit right into my new schedule. I Hope to write about everything from coding to vacationing *to who knows what!*

> Since I have molded my blog workflow into my programming workflow, I think I can manage to blog at least once every day, right? I thought so.

To start off my development writing, I will state that I have been working on a massive Discord bot called Mini Me. For those of you who don't know what Discord is, it is like a web-based chat service. Tons of people use it, including gamers, programmers, social groups, and even business offices. But back to my bot. My bot, Mini Me, is a fully featured creation that I cannot stop adding on to. I hope to reach the top of the popularity charts with my bot in the near future.

On to this past summer! I got to go to Florida, and go parasailing. \(the most exciting thing I did this summer, aside from going to the TobyMac concert.\) I also got to go paddleboarding on the ocean, which is not as fun as it sounds. I also got to go to Branson, which is a tourist town not far from where I live in Missouri, and do some of the things I haven't done on previous visits.

School just recently started \(August 15th, to be exact\), and all has been going well with that. Finally got to see some of my friends after a long summer. I'm also meeting tons of new people, and thank god freshmen this year aren't like they were last year.

I really want to create some more music lately, but I don't really know what I want to create, much less do I have the resources needed to create it. ~~If you've got an overpowered laptop, email me.~~

Anyway, I thought I'd leave you at that. Please, come back soon to see what comes next!
